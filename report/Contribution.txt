Individual section python Matriculation Number: 160026253For this practical we tried to split the work up, however unfortunately that did not always happen as sometimes we did not speak and meet up as much as I would have liked. A team member had worked on the first two bullet points in the basic specification so I said I would complete the word cloud and the visualisation for the number of tweets, retweets and replies. For this visualisation, I originally used mathPlot, but as time went on and I looked at more ways of created visualisations in python I decided to change the graphs to instead use Plotly. This allowed graphs to be somewhat more interactive as they can be zoomed in on and when hovered over they will display the actual number of that section of the graph. In order to implement the word cloud, I imported word cloud which allowed the creation of a word cloud from the hashtags.I then looked at seeing how users were sending tweets in the dataset. This involved splitting the source section of the CSV file and then splitting the source until the application could be found. After each of the applications had been found a pie-chart was created to show what share of the tweets were sent from each of the top applications. I then created more graphs for the most used hashtags and a pie-chart for the languages used throughout the dataset. Finally, the dataset was analysed for to see how many tweets were sent for each of the days in the dataset. After I had created each of these graphs I then analysed each of them to highlight what the graphs actually show and the possible reasons for each of these graphs. I then adapted the notebook so it included some report aspects such as headers, and observation section and a conclusion.
